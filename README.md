This example demonstrates a potential issue with the REDEFINES clause in COBOL.  The REDEFINES clause allows you to define multiple data structures that share the same storage area. However, this can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful. In this specific case, modifying a field within the redefined structure can lead to the unexpected overwriting of data in the original structure. The solution shows how to avoid this by carefully considering data alignment and ensuring data integrity.
